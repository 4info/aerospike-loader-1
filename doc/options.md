| -rt <read-threads>        | Number of read threads to use on the local machine running the Aerospike-Loader. Increasing the number of threads will make the reading process faster, but setting the value too high may overload the local machine. Usually read threads are faster than write threads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Number of cores * 1 |

| -et <expiration-time>      | Expiration time of records in seconds. Other valid values are: set it to -1 for records to never expire and 0 to use server default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | -1                  |
